# bnp-step

This repository contains the Python scripts and helper functions for BNP-Step, a computational method described in [An accurate probabilistic step finder for time-series analysis, bioRxiv 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.19.558535v1).

## Usage

BNP-Step was developed in Python 3.11 using numpy 1.24.3, scipy 1.10.1, matplotlib 3.7.1, and pandas 1.5.3. Conda users can replicate the development environment by creating a new environment using the included stepfind.yml file:

```python
conda env create -f stepfind.yml
```

Once your environment is set up, you can run BNP-Step in three ways:

1. un from Jupyter Notebook or from GUI (NYI)

2. Run2

3. Run3


## Comparisons to other methods

Also includes implementation of KV method and helper utilities to aid comparison to iHMM
